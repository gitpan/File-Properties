File::Properties
================

This module provides a class representing properties of a disk file,
with particular emphasis on media (image, video, and audio) files. The
mime type and a SHA-2 digest can be computed for any regular file, and
these properties are also available for the content of bzip2 and gzip
compressed files. Additional mime type and EXIF properties are
available for media files, and a SHA-2 digest of the actual pixel data
is available for image files. Since some of these properties can be
expensive to compute, data is cached in an SQLite database so that
properties only need to be computed from file data on the initial
access.

There should be no machine dependencies as the module is 
written purely in Perl.
